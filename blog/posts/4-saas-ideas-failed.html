        <p>
          I'm a developer from Nepal. For the past few weeks, I've been trying to find a SaaS idea that people would actually pay for.
        </p>

        <p>
          I didn't build anything. No code. Just landing pages and validation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Four ideas. Zero traction. Here's what actually happened.
        </p>

        <h2>Idea #1: Gigfolio - Finance Dashboard for Freelancers</h2>

        <p>
          The pitch was simple: track your irregular income and set aside taxes automatically. As a developer who does freelance work, I thought this was a no-brainer.
        </p>

        <p>
          I posted about it on Reddit. Got a few views. Zero signups.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then came this comment:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "People who are surprised by income tax shouldn't freelance."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          That hit different.
        </p>

        <p>
          The problem wasn't urgent. Freelancers deal with chaotic income, sure. But they've been dealing with it for years using spreadsheets. My solution was a "nice-to-have," not a "must-have."
        </p>

        <p>
          I tried different angles. Posted on r/EntrepreneurRideAlong about how "freelancing income is chaotic" and how I built a tool to help. One person said it sounded helpful. That's it. One person.
        </p>

        <p>
          The posts got removed from r/upwork and r/freelance. Not a great sign when the communities you're targeting don't even want to hear about your solution.
        </p>

        <h2>Idea #2: Fileloop - Client File Portal</h2>

        <p>
          Next idea: stop sharing messy Google Drive links with clients. Give them one clean portal instead.
        </p>

        <p>
          I built a landing page. Posted it on Reddit asking for feedback. Got a few signups this time.
        </p>

        <p>
          But when I talked to people, the response was always the same: "Google Drive works fine."
        </p>

        <p>
          "Messy" wasn't painful enough. People tolerate messy. They've been tolerating it for years. Unless you're solving something that actively costs them money or clients, they won't switch.
        </p>

        <p>
          Someone on r/SaaS said the landing page looked good. Someone on r/web_design called me out for the "nonsensical story" I used to promote it. Fair enough. I was trying too hard.
        </p>

        <p>
          I even bought a domain. fileloop.co. That's $12 I'm not getting back.
        </p>

        <h2>Idea #3: Fileloop Pivot - Client Onboarding Portal</h2>

        <p>
          Maybe the problem wasn't file sharing. Maybe it was collecting information from clients in the first place.
        </p>

        <p>
          New pitch: stop chasing clients for project info. Send them one link with auto-reminders and auto-save.
        </p>

        <p>
          While researching, I found <a href="https://contentsnare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Content Snare</a> and <a href="https://www.dubsado.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dubsado</a> already doing this. More importantly, I realized something obvious: I'm not a freelancer who deals with client onboarding.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was guessing problems I don't personally live with.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's the trap. You read about problems on Reddit, watch YouTube videos about "underserved markets," and think you understand the pain. You don't. Not really.
        </p>

        <p>
          One commenter on my validation post asked a question that stuck with me:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "Are your dropoffs happening during the form submission or after? That'll help you figure out if you need a form redesign or if the issue is something else."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          I didn't know. Because I wasn't deep enough in the problem to know what questions to even ask.
        </p>

        <h2>Idea #4: Django + React Payments Boilerplate</h2>

        <p>
          Okay, forget B2B. Let me sell to developers. I know developers.
        </p>

        <p>
          The pitch: drop-in Stripe + auth setup for Django + React projects. Cheaper than SaaSPegasus ($249+). Just the payments and auth part. $49-99. (I actually documented the <a href="deploy-drf-production.html">production Django deployment setup</a> I use.)
        </p>

        <p>
          I posted on r/django. The feedback was brutal.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "No because like all those so called projects is just dumb AI slop."
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          "Nowadays thanks to AI and automations I completely stopped looking for boilerplates. I can implement it really fast."
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          "Copy+paste+edit. I don't think I'm going to be changing just yet."
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          "I've done this so many times I just have it templated already. And AI now does this flawlessly for pennies."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          That made something clear: AI changed the game. Developers don't want to pay for code anymore. ChatGPT can scaffold a Stripe integration in minutes. Why would anyone pay $49 for something they can generate for free?
        </p>

        <p>
          This wasn't just a bad idea. It was a bad market. Developers are the hardest customers because they can build things themselves. And now they have AI doing the boring parts.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Actually Learned</h2>

        <p>
          Four failures in two weeks. Here's what stuck:
        </p>

        <h3>1. Validating before building saved me months</h3>

        <p>
          I spent $25 on domains. That's it. No weeks of coding. No "just one more feature" trap. If I had built any of these, I'd still be tweaking them, convincing myself that the next update would change everything.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Nice-to-have products don't sell</h3>

        <p>
          "It would be nice to have cleaner file sharing." "It would be nice to track my freelance income better." Nice doesn't open wallets.
        </p>

        <p>
          People pay for must-haves. Problems that cost them money, time, or sanity every single day.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Developers are a terrible market</h3>

        <p>
          They can build anything themselves. They have strong opinions about code. And now AI does the boring parts for free. Unless you're solving a genuinely hard problem, developers will just DIY it.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Domain knowledge matters more than YouTube advice</h3>

        <p>
          I kept hunting for ideas on Reddit, YouTube, Twitter. I kept ending up in markets I don't actually understand.
        </p>

        <p>
          The best advice I got was this:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "Pick an industry and get good at it. Be the expert. The validation that takes landing pages and surveys can all be done in 5 minutes if you really know your industry."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          I was an outsider trying to guess insider problems. That rarely works.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Failing early is cheap if you allow it to be</h3>

        <p>
          Two domain purchases. Some Reddit posts. A few conversations. That's all it cost to learn that four ideas weren't worth building.
        </p>

        <p>
          Compare that to spending months building something nobody wants. Early failure is a feature, not a bug.
        </p>

        <h2>The Feedback That Hit Different</h2>

        <p>
          When I shared this journey on r/Entrepreneur, people actually responded:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "The lessons from all of this is more valuable than the possible money you would've gained. Cause now you're in the game and you know what needs to be done."
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          "You definitely saved yourself a headache by testing early."
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          "This is the post I wish I read earlier."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Someone pointed out that posting on social media for validation is a trap because intent is so low. People scrolling Reddit aren't actively looking for solutions. That's why directories and communities where people are actively searching might work better.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another person asked:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "How did you bridge that gap between 'seeing a problem' and genuinely feeling its urgency enough to dedicate months to solving it?"
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Honestly? I haven't bridged that gap yet. That's the whole point. I was seeing problems online without feeling them myself.
        </p>

        <h2>What's Next</h2>

        <p>
          Right now, I don't have a new idea. I'm taking a break to clear my head.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead of hunting for ideas online, I'm trying something different: paying attention to what annoys me in my own work. The small, repetitive frustrations I've learned to tolerate.
        </p>

        <p>
          The best ideas come from problems you personally feel. Not from Reddit threads about "underserved markets."
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm still learning. Still exploring. Still figuring things out.
        </p>

        <p>
          But here's what I know for sure: validating four bad ideas taught me more than planning one "perfect" idea for months ever would.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're stuck in the idea phase, just start testing. Make a landing page. Talk to people. Get rejected. Learn why.
        </p>

        <p>
          $25 and two weeks. That's what it cost me to learn what doesn't work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Not a bad deal.
        </p>
